# BottomNavBar With Naviagtion Compose and Safe Args


This repository demonstrates how to implement a Bottom Navigation Bar using Jetpack Compose in Android. It provides a simple and clean example of how to use Compose to build a modern Android application with a bottom navigation and Safe Args.

## Features

- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern Android UI toolkit for building native UIs.
- **Bottom Navigation Bar**: Easy navigation between different screens.


### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ahmedelbagory332/Compose_with_bottom_navBar.git
    ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Build and run the project on an emulator or physical device.

## Usage

This project includes a basic implementation of a Bottom Navigation Bar with three sample screens. The navigation is handled using Jetpack Compose's navigation component and Safe Args.

### Screens

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/863e69fc-2682-4e96-b40c-a1b822256887" width=270 height=480></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3281abdb-9c03-4874-ad23-d540a91ed406" width=270 height=480></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/222b4d01-7693-429b-8f5c-87eb91aaf5a8" width=270 height=480></td>
   </tr>
 </table>

### Navigation

The navigation between screens is handled using `NavHost` and `NavController` from Jetpack Compose's navigation library and Safe Args.
